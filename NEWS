GCompris 8.4
------------
* Fixed "-l list" option to load the menu list from the base.
  option was not working when boards are compiled statically.
* Now we don't crash if we cannot find a single image at startup.
* Fixed a major bug, target activity is broken, the target never reach it's goal.
* Moved the lock file checking downstairs in the startup
  sequence to avoid for exemple 'gcompris -v' to being locked.
* missingletter: GCompris was asserting when you click on the target image
* Now all voices are in a separated svn module.
  The voices must now be put under boards/voices/<locale> instead of
  boards/sounds/<locale>
  To get the voices installed in the proper place, simply run:
  make update-voices
  Re-encoded voices in a lower bitrate, saving 40MB on the tarball
* Chronos activity: removed hardcoded translations
* doubleentry: fixed call to audio voices.
* algorithm: Fixed the skip of a level after the call to the help.
* shapegame:
  - Fixed bad reference to hand image to catch small icon
  - fixed, it was missing a X offset coming from
    the box of shapes on the left. It was mostly visible in the doubleentry activity where
    it was not easy to spot the target.
  - use the larger button for the tooltip (country name too large)
  - Translated The Text In Tooltip Were Invalid.
  - Removed text shadow as it isn't always cute depending on the fonts.
* memory: space sound 2 was twice in the list. If they were
  both selected in the game, the children was proposed the same sound
  in 4 spot making the game bugged.
* login: fixed a little bug, in text entry mode
 it was not displayed again if you open/close the help.

New translation:
* Added Afrikaans support.

<<< SNIP JUST FORGOT TO UPDATE THIS FILE FOR 6 YEARS >>>

GCompris 0.6.1
--------------
2001-05-21  Bruno Coudoin  <bruno.coudoin@free.fr>
	* GCompris 0.6.1
	* GCompris is now a GNU Package
	* WARNING: THE TRANSLATION IS BROKEN.
	* Complete rewrite to have boards being independant plugins
	* Directory change to have only one root dir for boards data
	* Added the scales board

2001-02-18  Bruno Coudoin  <bruno.coudoin@free.fr>
	* GCompris : Release 0.4.1
	* WARNING: Since images have changed a lot, it is mandatory to
	           remove old images from /usr/share/pixmaps/gcompris/*
	           or whatever directory they are installed on your system.
	           This should be done automatically by RPM and DEB package users.
	* Added the documentation. It can be browsed directly from
	  GCompris help menu or with GNU info
	* The falling animals board has been replaced by fishes
	  This has to be done due to the unkwown knowledge of the
	  author of the animals and of their licensing.
	  Fishes are taken from the project xfishtank and are free of
	  right.
	* Added the planegame board. This board let you drive a plane
	  and your goal is to catch the clouds in the increasing order.
	  The way the plane is moved (relative speed) confuses a lot the
	  children. I feel it is good to have them learn this way of
	  controlling an object.
	* Added the shape board which feature a puzzle of old
	  impresionists paintings.
	* Removed the sounds. I discovered that the sounds I were using
	  was the standard Gnome ones. I now point to them, so no sounds
	  are included in GCompris. I did this to be sure that I don't
	  include file I am not sure of their origin and copyright status.
