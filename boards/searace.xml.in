	<_goal>In this activity, you will learn how to enter commands to a computer.
Even if the language is extremely basic, you learn here how to think ahead and enter a program.
This activity can be used to introduce the programming concept to kids.</_goal>
	<_manual>In the text entry, enter line by line commands to give direction to your boat.
Commands supported are displayed between the two entry area.
The 'left' and 'right' commands must be suffixed by an angle in degree. The angle value is also
called a 'parameter' to the left or right command. By default 45 degree is used.
The 'forward' command accept a distance parameter. By default 1 is used.
For example:
left 90    => Make a perpendicular left turn
forward 10 => Go forward for 10 units (as displayed in the ruler)
The goal is to reach the right of the screen (the red line).
When done, you can try to improve your program and start a new race with the same weather
 conditions by using the retry button.
Going to the next level will give your more complex wether conditions.</_manual>
