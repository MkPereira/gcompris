This document describes howto create a localized version of the sounds.

1) Create your sounds directory
   ----------------------------
First copy the english sounds as a template in a new directory with you locale name (e.g. my)
cd boards/sounds
cp -r en my

Provide here voice translation in boards/sounds/my for each english sounds.

2) Recording / Encoding
   --------------------
It is best to choose somebody that speaks and articulate well your language.

- Record with rec, grecord, bcast2000, gnoise, audacity
  (mono wav 16bit/44100Hz gives the best quality/space ratio)

  44100Hz is MANDATORY. On some system with bad supported sound card
  other frequency lead to major troubles.

- Save as WAV file
- Apply loudness transform with sox if necessary.
	You may such script if the sound is too low :
	#!/bin/sh
	for i; do
			sox $i modif/$i vol 5.0 amplitude 0.05
	done
- Transforming stereo to mono if needed
        sox y.wav -c 1 y2.wav
- In the directory where WAV files are run i
        oggenc -c "Copyright 2002 (name of author). This file is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, either version 2 or ( at your option) any later version. See the file COPYING for details." *.wav
	if ogginfo doesn't show you the comment, replace the -c to -a to store
	the copyright in the author field
- Copy OGG files in the corresponding directory

Note that you won't be abble to test them until the integration with gcompris is comptete (step 4).

3) Shipping
   --------
Once done, the easiest way is to tar all this files and send them to the gcompris maitainer.
cd boards/sounds
tar -cvzf sounds_my.tgz my

4) Integration
   -----------
Nothing has to be done.
Run gcompris in your locale and you should ear your voices.

5) Checking
   --------
At top level, run:
./tools/check_missing_voices.pl <locale>

With for example locale being fr for French.
