The format of the data files for gtraffic is very simple.  The general
structure of one of the datafiles is as follows.

[LevelX]
CardY=string describing card 1
CardY=string describing card 2
...
Where X is the Gcompris Level (in the control bar)
Where Y is the sublevel.

The strings used to describe the cards begins with two numbers describing the
level:
- number of cars that must be removed
- minimum number of moves possible
These number are coma separated like 1,8

This is followed by a space separated list defining the cars on the
grid. So the string looks as follows:

xpos,ypos,orientation,for_goal,length,color ...

- xpos and ypos are numbers between 0 and 5 that specify the cars 
  position on the grid

- orientation is either 0 or 1
  - 0 means that the car moves vertically
  - 1 means the car moves horizontally

- for_goal is either a zero or a one where a one specifies that this car 
  is part of the goal and will be allowed to escape the grid through the slot

- length is the number of grid units, typically two or three

- color is a string that says what color to draw that card as which is 
  usually a string like red, but it can handle anything that XParseColor(3X11)
  can handle
