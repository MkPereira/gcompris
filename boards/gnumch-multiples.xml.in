         <manual>The multiples of a number are all the numbers that are equal to the original number times another number. For example, 24, 36, 48 and 60 are all multiples of 12. 25 is not a multiple of 12 because there isn't any number that can be multiplied by 12 to get 25. If one number is a factor of a second number, then the second number is a multiple of the first number.
