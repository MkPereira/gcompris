	<_goal>In this game, children can draw freely.
The goal is just to discover how to create pretty-looking drawings based on
basic shapes: rectangles, ellipses and lines. To make it more fun for kids,
a set of images can also be used.</_goal>
	<_manual>Select a drawing tool on the left and a color on the bottom. Then click
and drag in the white area to create a new shape. Once one drawing is complete, you
can take a snapshot of it with the 'camera' button. A new image with the same content is
created. You can then move objects a little bit or add/delete objects. Create several
drawings and then click on the 'film' button. You will see all your images in an infinite
loop. You can change the viewing speed in this mode.
In view mode, click on the 'drawing' button to return to drawing. You can then edit each
image of your animation by using the image selector in the bottom left of the screen.
You can save and reload your animations with the 'floppy' and 'folder' button.
