Tangram (Chinese: literally "seven boards of cunning") is a Chinese puzzle. While the tangram is often said to be ancient, its existence has only been verified as far back as 1800.
It consists of 7 pieces, called tans, which fit together to form a square; taking the square as the unit:
* 5 right isosceles triangles
    o 2 small (legs of 1)
    o 1 medium size (legs of square root of 2)
    o 2 large size (legs of 2)
* 1 square (side of 1)
* 1 parallelogram (sides of 1 and square root of 2)</_goal>
	<_manual>Select the tangram to form.
Move a piece by dragging it.
Right click on it to create a symetrical item.
Select an item and drag around it for the rotation
Once the requested shape is created, it will be recognized by the computer
If you need help, click on the shape button, the border of the shape will be drawn.</_manual>
