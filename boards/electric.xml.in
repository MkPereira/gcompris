        <_description>Create and simulate an electric schema</_description>
        <_prerequisite>Need some basic understanding on the electricity concept.</_prerequisite>
        <_goal>Freely create an electric schema with a real time simulation of it.</_goal>
        <_credit>GCompris uses the Gnucap electric simulator as a backend (&lt;http://geda.seul.org/tools/gnucap/&gt;)</_credit>
        <_manual>Drag electrical component from the selector and drop them on the working area. Create wires by clicking on a connection spot and dropping on another one. You can move components by dragging them. You can delete wires by clicking on them. To delete a component, select the deletion tool on the top of the component selector. The simulation is updated in real time on any user action.</_manual>
