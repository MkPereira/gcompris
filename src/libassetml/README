About AssetML

AssetML defines an xml file that let application developper to use it as a resource database.

The idea is to associate image, sounds and video to a single asset. This way, an application can search for a specific resource.
XML File format

Here is basically a description of the xml file

 <AssetML dataset="gcompris numbers" rootdir="../gcompris/boards/numbers/">
  <Asset audiofile="1.ogg" imagefile="1.png" videofile="1.mpg">
   <_Name>One</_Name>
   <_Description>The number One</_Description>
   <AudioCredits>Who did the audio / Licence info</AudioCredits>
   <ImageCredits>Who did the image / Licence info</ImageCredits>
   <VideoCredits>Who did the video / Licence info</VideoCredits>
   <Categories>number;math;algebra</Categories>
  </Asset>
 </AssetML>

I18N issues

Note the tags _Name and _Description, this is used by the intltool to add these strings in the .po file. The big advantage is that translators uses regular .po files. It is definitly very efficient for the maintenance.

While intltool are a gnome development, there is no dependancy with gnome, it's just perl scripts and are needed only at build time, not installation time.

After xml-i18n parsing we would end up with:

 <AssetML dataset="gcompris numbers" rootdir="../gcompris/boards/numbers/">
  <Asset audiofile="1.ogg" imagefile="1.png" videofile="1.mpg">
   <Name>One</Name>
   <Description>The number One</Description>
   <Name xml:lang="fr">Un</Name>
   <Description xml:lang="fr">Numero Un</Description>
   <AudioCredits>Who did the audio / Licence info</AudioCredits>
   <ImageCredits>Who did the audio / Licence info</ImageCredits>
   <VideoCredits>Who did the audio / Licence info</VideoCredits>
   <Categories>number;math;algebra</Categories>
  </Asset>
 </AssetML>

File extension and Location

To easily find assetml file, they must have the extension .assetml and be located in $prefix/share/pixmaps

The images, audio and video themselves can be placed anywhere and they will be found by merging the attribute rootdir of AssetML and the xxxfile attribute.
Where to place file when I18N is needed

For the audio file and video file, there is a file notation to discover if the file exist in the current locale. The token % is used to represent the locale. For example, imagefile="1_%.png" will be searched as 1_fr.png for the french resource, or, audiofile="audios/%/1.ogg" will be search as audios/de/1.ogg for the german resource.

This way, the packager can organise its asset files the way he/she wants within the archive.
Packaging issues

Of course, only one resource (image, audio or video) is mandatory to define an asset.

In order to avoid to create huge resource files, we could create separate packages that all put their .assetml file in a predefined directory for example /usr/share/assetml and from here, our apps could parse the xml files and filter in them searching for a specific info. Here, the categories field could be used to display car or tree for example.

One still could of course create a package dependancy to the resources package is they are mandatory for its app to work.
API proposal

Here is an example of API that could be used to implement AssetML

 /* Returns a list of AssetML struct
    dataset: the name of the dataset, NULL for ANY dataset
    categories: a list of categorie columns ';' separated
    name: the asset name to get or NULL for any name
    locale: a locale string 2 or 5 digits (LL_SS) of NULL for current locale
 */

 GList*  assetml_get_asset(gchar *dataset, gchar* categories, gchar* name, gchar* locale)

 struct AssetML
 {
  gchar         *dataset;
  gchar         *categories;
  gchar         *name;
  gchar         *audiofile;
  gchar         *audiofile;
  gchar         *videofile;
  gchar         *audiocredit;
  gchar         *audiocredit;
  gchar         *videocredit;
 };
